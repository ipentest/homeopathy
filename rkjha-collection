MURIATIC ACID
MURIATIC ACID the VERTIGO comes on moving eyes, and on LYING RIGHT SIDE(GELS, RHUS T). This vertigo is sometimes associated with with liver disease.
A stout, full-blooded jaundiced man about forty had suffered much from pain in the liver, with great soreness, was comfortable only when lying on left side, when he TURNED on his back or RIGHT SIDE an anxious vertigo would come at once and he would break out in copious sweat, and be forced back to the left side. MURIATIC ACID made a complete cure of this liver trouble, which had been pronounced serious.

CALADIUM; Forgetfulness in persons who are mentally and physically prostrated from sexual excesses or from tobacco poisoning. It is indicated in old debauches who are unable to perform the merital act. He has the most tantalizing craving for the opposite sex with no ability to perform coitus. Lascivious ideas. Such men stand on the street corner and feast upon the forms of passing girls, and their seman dribbles away; a state also found in PICRIC ACID and SELENIUM. You can only cure these patients if they desire to reform, and if you can inspire them to live a better life. Without this you cannot save them, and those who take delight in such things are not worth saving, and medicine will not take hold of them. To cure, the patient must use his will to help the remedy.

DR ADOLPH LIPPE once made a splendid cure of a complete one-sided paralysis in a man 80 years of age with this remedy, and was guided to it by this symptom. I think it would be rather a difficult task to give correct pathological explanation of such a symptom; but there is a reason, and whether we can give it or not we can cure it.

ALLEN KEY-NOTES--ANT T- ASPHYXIA : MECHANICAL, as apparently death from drowing; from MUCUS IN BRONCHI; from impending PARALYSIS OF LUNGS ;foreign bodies in larynx or trachia; with DROWSINESS AND COMA. 
The unfortunate children, born after a difficult labour, fall roughly into two classes- the BLUE or ASPHYXIATED AND the PALE.
The child with BLUE ASPHYXIA has no mechanical obstruction, but he does not breathe. Surface stimulation does not produce the desired effect, or does this for a very short time only. Very soon pulse begins to fail. Everyone is becoming anxious. Unpleasant thoughts begin to suggest themselves; thoughts of the mother and all she has just come through, thoughts of the father waiting for news, begin to force their way through. A dose of LAUROCERASUS and the whole scene is changed, the child breathes and then cries.
The PALE ,COLLAPSED child is less dramatic and more pitiful. It lies LIMP, FLACCID, COLD. Its heart sounds are hardly to be heard. It is all but dead. Warmth, stimulants, friction, seem to produce no response. The child lies as one drowned. CARBO VEG will give child back, alive into its mother's arms.

It has the ability to delay the formation of malignant growths, especially in the breast; glandular tumors that become hard and scirrhous. Until this remedy was known there was but one remedy for the old cicatrices in the memmary gland. Women who were confined years before, had access of the breast which were poulticed and lanced had a cicatricx left, and now in the present confinement they have trouble; inflammation in the old cicatrices; ulceration which eats off the lacteal glands or turns the ducts aside and twists them; high inflammation; throbbing and pain; milk bloody. GRAPHITIS was the old routine remedy, but PHYTOLACCA is a better remedy and suits the general concomitants oftener. The symptoms usually found in an inflamed breast after confinement are; Aching in the back and bone pains; fever and shivering. PHYTOLACCA has these and falls into the very nature of the case. GRAPHITES has it only limited way. If there is high fever; congestion to the head; throbbing carotids; much redness, and the redness radiates from the nipple, BELLADONA is the remedy. When the entire gland is as heavy as a stone, and hard, and the patient is sensitive to motion and touch, BRYONIA. MERCURY when the general symptoms agree. HEPAR and SILICEA after suppuration is envitable, especially when the only comfort is obtained from heat. HEPAR when there is extreme pain and soreness, irritability and this relief from heat; it limits the extent of the suppuration and opens the part without pain.

PERICARDITIS
A female patient H S., aged 27 was admitted to the hospital on 22-4-59 with a history of pain in the left chest and pyrexia of four days duration. On admission her temperature was 99f;respiration 30 and pulse 120; The pain was stitching, stabbing and cutting in nature and was worse from 1pm to 4p.m. and from coughing and was accompanied by profuse perspiration. It was relieved by warm applications. She could not lie on her left side. There was dullness of the left base with diminution of breath sounds. A provisional diagnosis of plurisy with effusion was made.
The X-Ray taken later read as follows:"Huge dilatation of the heart;Pericarditis with effusion also pleural effusion left base and thickened pleura, left upper zone; congestive cardiac failure.
The blood, urine and stools reports showed N.A.D.
The remedy KALI CARB was found to cover the following symptoms in BOGER SYNOPTIC KEY
1.Morning and evening agg
2. Stitches
3. Cough painful
4. Dropsy
5. Cutting
6. Sweat, in general
A reference to the materia medica portion(p- 224) showed that the drug also covered the symptoms "worse lying on painful side" and "Better warmth".
So she was given KALI CARB 200 six hourly. There was an immediate improvement which continued steadily. On the fourth day, the dose was reduced to thrice a day and later to twice a day. The temperature ranged intermittently up to 1-5-59 and then came down and stayed normal. Her pain lessened and disappeared. On the fourth day after admission, she was able to lie on the left side with comfort.
The second X-Ray taken on 15-5-59 showed " Heart size markedly diminished; Slight pleural effusion still presents".
The patient was discharged a week later and has remained well.

HAPPY WOMEN'S DAY
THE PHYSICIAN can have the pregnant woman under his care during the period of gestation he ought to be able to select remedies to remove their irregular contractions of the uterus, or to prevent them when it comes time for labor. The pains are not so violent. She feels the contractions, but in many instances they are painless. You will not always be able to prepare women , they will not always permit it.
A woman that knows much about Homoeopathy would submit herself regularly to constitutional treatment during gestation, that is,would be particular to give the physician everything,all the details,all the sufferings, all the trouble,that he may study the case. The things that are to be observed during gastation are to be added to the constitutional symptoms found when gestation is not present,because they are all evidence of a disturbance in that one patient. And it is the patient that is to be treated, not a disease.

It is not such an unusual thing in the female to have aversion to sexual intercourse, but man is not often subject to the complaints that cause aversion to coition. Yet we have in man as well as in the woman actual aversion or a state of no enjoyment. He can perform the act and he has no difficulty in obtaining an erection, so it is not impotence; but there is no enjoyment. Impotence comes later. "Absence of erections; parts flabby, torpid." " Aversion to coition; impotence; want of emission during coitus."---PSORINUM is the remedy

Aversion to marriage is a strong symptoms. A man takes it into his head that it is an evil thing to have sexual intercourse with his wife and abstains from it. Think of PULSATILLA
In KENT'S Repertory rubric---
Marriage, the idea of seemed unendurable-- LACH, PIC- AC, PULS

Now you will take notice in practice and remember it, that coition is a natural thing with man, when it is carried on in order, and when that which is natural is followed by prostration, and this has been so for a long time, there is a break in the constitution, there is something radically wrong. All the symptoms are likely to be worse after coition in KALI CARB. He has weak vision, weakness of the senses, tremulousness, and is generally nervous; he is sleepless, and weak, and he shivers and trembles for a day or two after coition. Similar symptoms are observed in the woman. In spite of the fact that the patient is weak, the sexual desire is excessive. It is not orderly. There is a sexual erethism, which is not under the command of the will, and in the male he is subject to copious and frequent pollutions, nightly dreams, sexual prostration.
Young man who have abused themselves, and who have indulged excessively in sexual pleasure, go into marriage with weakened genitals, incapacitated; and then there comes a disgust, and it is not strange and there are so many divorces in the world. When patient is young, some of this trouble can be overcome by living an orderly life and correct HOMOEOPATHY.

The pitiful,woebegone young man, heart broken over his early life, now find himself newly married, and impotent. He has had gonorrhoea; he has lived in excesses, and now suffers from relaxed and cold genitalia, emissions, prostatic discharge at stool. His young and beautiful wife excites no erection, though only recently he had a clandestine success, and he has morning erections but no more.
Out of the above cause and condition come many distressing symptoms. Loss of memory, despair, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, fear and peevishness. These patients suffer from headaches, photophobia and nervous symptoms too numerous to mention. Formication of the skin. Tearing pains to head, face and teeth. All but the simplest food disorders the stomach, and he complaints much of nausia. His muscles are flabby. He is anaemic, and his glands are enlarged, especially the spleen. He is growing increasingly flatulent. The abdominal viscera hang down as a weight. There is a growing weakness of the rectum and constipation, and he presses hard at stool, which often fails and slips back, like Silicea, Sanicula and Thuja. The stool is large and hard. He soon takes on a hacking cough and night sweats. The limbs are tired and cold. He is sensitive to cold, and wants to remain quiet. Exertion and motion intensify his complaints. He has been to many advisers, and they have told him he has NEURASTHENIA. He must have AGNUS CASTUS.

URAEMIA
Some years ago a physician came to me in the regard to his wife. She had been unconscious for two days and had passed no urine for days and the catheter showed there was none in the bladder. She had quite an array of symptoms, but they were common symptoms. She had had the slowness for days before, and complained of a sensation of a continual pulling at the navel, as if string were drawing it back to the spinal column, and then the coma came on. In the middle of the night this doctor came to me in great distress. He said she was pale as death and breathing slow. A single powder of PLUMBUM high was given, and she passed urine in a few hours, roused up and never had such an attack.

Absence or suppression of menses for many months, the patient being withered, declining, pale and sallow, becoming feeble. It seems that she has not the vitality to menstruate. It is also suitable in girls at puberty when the time for the first menstrual flow to appear has come, but it does not come. She goes 15,16,17,or 18 years without development, the breast do not enlarge, the overies do not perform their functions. When the symptoms agree LYCOPODIUM establishes a reaction, the breast begin to grow, the womanly bearing begins to come, and the child becomes a woman.

CICUTA VIROSA
GUERNSEY says," Think of this remedy for convulsions which are excessively violent- whether epileptic, cataleptic, clonic or tonic ; eclampsia."
The convulsions extend from center to circumference. The convulsion spread from above downwards and thus it is opposite of CUPRUM. The convulsions of CPRUM spread from the extremities to the centre; the little convulsions, cramps are first felt in fingers then hands, later in chest and whole body. In CICUTA the little convulsions of head, eyes and throat spread down the back with violent contortions.
Between the convulsions the patient is mild, gentle, placid,yielding, reverse of NUX V and STRYCH. NUX V has convulsions all over the body, worse for touch and draught,blueness: between the convulsions the patient is very irritable.
After swallowing a fish bone or stick which lodges in the throat a spasm comes on. After CICUTA the spasm will cease and it can be taken out. It is useful in cases of injury, accompanied with violent choking, so that he can not allow an examination to be made.
"Barber's itch:" trouble from shaving."
Mind and head symptoms after injuries.
"At times he knows no one, but when touched and spoken to be answers correctly."

A knowledge of many symptoms is of small value, while on the other hand learning how to examine a patient and then to find the remedy is of the utmost importance. The common way of eliciting well-known key-notes and prescribing accordingly is a most pernicious practice, which has earned a deserved odium and is no improvement upon the theoretical methods of the old school.
The various cravings and aversions are highly significant, especially when combined with the patient's behaviour toward solitude, light, noise, company or any other daily environment. The most expressive new symptom is usually the key to the whole case and directly related to all of the others, and is often expressed by a change of temper or other mental condition. Such apparent trifles reveal the enner man to the acute observer and have proven the undoing and insufficiency of liberal Homoeopathy.

The giving of ARNICA MONT after confinement is as old as Homoeopathy, but just to state that I do not always consider this to be good practice for the reason that in a majority of cases no remedy whatever is either needed or indicated and when one is called for it is not always ARNICA by any means. If we have reason to think that the deeper tissues have suffered most, a single drop of tincture BELLIS PERENIS will do much more than ARNICA and give you a pleasant surprise in the results that follows.
DR C M BOGER.
After childbirth you should use BELLIS PERENIS after childbirth and save your ARNICA.This is better remedy it has more affinity for uterus.
You can give 30C routinely after childbirth and you will see that the pain and bleeding will stop, it will help the sore bruised tenderness in the entire uterus area the uterus will go back to its normal shape quicker the person's energy will come up .

PULSATILLA has all these symptoms in the highest type, and has caused dreams of cats! Pulsatilla in high potency was given in September,1929,and in January 1930,for a threat. She has remained well ever since.

It is true that worms will not prosper in a perfectly healthy stomach, intestine or rectum. They can only thrive in the unhealthy. Many a time I have had a patient bring me a tape-worm in a bottle after I had put them on an antipsoric, even when I did not suspects its existence. Turn the economy into order and the parasites go. The same applies to germs. They only exist as a result of disease. They have never been known to exist without the disease having first existed. If you ignore the worm,but select the remedy on the totality of the symptoms,the patient will be restored to health,and,so far as the worm concerned, go without a symptom. The worm become smaller,shrivels and finally departs. It is rarely the case for the worm to disappear inside of six weeks after the remedy. If, on the other hand, you eject the worm by violent means, the patient may go for years with troublesome symptoms,and you do not know why you fail to cure him.
Prescribe for the patient first. No results of disease should be removed until proper constitutional treatment has been restored to, and be sure that it is proper.

CANCER CURES
In cancer patients, when painful conditions arise, for instance, diarrhoea or urinary disturbances, caution prescribing is necessary, that a remedy be not administered covering only the condition. Any prescription based on the more superficial, acute disorder, not covering the deeper, chronic, carcinomatous nature, will result in amelioration of the acute disorder only. Meanwhile suffering from the deeper affection will increase, and the progress of the deeper, malignant disorder will be more rapid.
Any prescription, to be of benefit to the patient, must have the nature of the chronic, as much as the nature of the acute manifestation.
The aim of the physician, first, last, and always, must be to find the remedy which most closely corresponds to the patient, and prescribe for the patient, whatever manifestation that patient may suffer, when the prescription is selected.
In CANCER patients, incurability depends upon the fact that new symptoms except those of the cancerous tissue change are obtainable. The sharp pains, the ulceration, and the anaemia are symptoms that preceded this period is necessary for gaining any curative results.
Ultimate do not indicate the remedy for the patient.

You get another type of neuralgia--- the sciaticas. And there again you can get helpful leads. In cases of sciatica, in which I can get no indications at all but the ordinary classical symptoms of sciatica, that is to say, acute pain down the sciatic nerve, which is aggravate by any movement, is very sensitive to cold, more comfortable if kept quiet and warm, then it depends which leg is involved what drug I give. If it is a right sided sciatica I give MAG PHOS, but if it is a left sided I give COLOCYNTH. And you would be astonished how often one gets almost immediate relief from either MAG PHOS or CLOCYNTH.
Some sciatica patients are frigtfully uncomfortable the longer they keep still, they have got to start moving, and there are to drugs which seem to cover the majority of these cases. If the patient is warm blooded, and the sciatic pains tend to be more troublesome when warm, particularly warmth of bed, and rather better when moving about, in the majority of instances one gets relief from KALI IOD.
If, on the other hand, you have very much the same modalities with a chilly patient, particularly if he is sensitive to damp as well as cold, and again more comfortable when moving about, RHUS TOX will clear majority of such cases.
Then there are one or two odd indications which sometimes help you in sciatica where you can get no other distinguishing symptoms. For instance, if you get a sciatica which has associated with the acute sciatic pain, marked numbness, there are two drugs which cover most of your cases. One is GNAPHALIUM, which has this sensation of numbness associated with pain and tenderness over the sciatic nerve more marked than any other drug in the materia medica.
The second drug which has this numbness associated with pain and tenderness of the sciatic nerve is PLUMBUM, and the main indication which suggests this remedy is that. I have never seen a sciatica giving indications for PLUMBUM which was not associated with extreme constipation as well as the pain and numbness.

KALI IOD cures sciatica when pain is sharp from the hip down, worse lying, sitting or standing and better walking.
RUTA GRAVEOLA the severest forms of sciatica; pains commence in the back and go down the hips and thighs; tearing pains; comfortable during the day, but aggravated as soon as he lies down at night.
GNAPHALIUM is a great sciatic remedy, and it also has this aggravation from lying down.
PULSATILLA; sciatica worse in the evening and better from slowly moving about.
COLOCYNTH; with many doctor it is a routine remedy for sciatica; and only when it fails to do they take the symptoms of the case in order to find the remedy that is indicated. There is no excuse for such practice. Where the pain is better from hard pressure and from heat, where it is worse during repose and drive the patient to despair, COLOCYNTH will generally cure. But it is not indicted in every cases

It is not to be used for the acute symptoms, not for the twinges of pain, but when the disease has become systemic, and when concretions of urate of soda appear in the joints. The worst case of this kind I ever saw was that of a man who had been bedridden fifteen years. He showed me a box which was filled with these concretions, which he had picked out of his joints. They varied in size and looked like lumps of chalk. Some of these same concretions could be seen under the skin and along the tendons. His hands were twisted out of shape. His feet also were affected. He had a cough, which finally killed him, and he expectorated from the lungs these lumps of urate of soda. AMMON PHOS relieved him for awhile.

The treatment of coughs is a severe test for the prescriber, and yet no patient demands a more careful going over than the one who coughs. In the addition to the above hints one should first carefully find out where and by what the coughing is excited. Ordinarily it is the result of an irritation starting from throat,larynx,chest or stomach,but it is specially necessary to know the exact point of origin.
Those beginning in the throat pit generally call for - bell, cham, nux v,rum,sang, sepia or silicea.
When the primary seems to be on the left side of the throat or larynx - bap, bell con,hepar, olanim, or sallcilic acid stands first, but if it is on the right side we look mostly to- dioscorea,iris-ver, phos, or stannum. Cough that come from what seems to be a dry spot generally need nat.our.or conium.
If a sense of a lump in the throat excites it, we have - bell,calc c,coc cact and lachasis. So the matter goes on indefinitely, with the accessories determining the final choice, but it not difficult to see how greatly our task is lightened NY being able to find the location of the exciting cause and then differentiate with the aid of modalities and the general picture.
This is the true homoeo pathic way and will bring unexpected aid, doing more than any other possible method. The sillimum re-stablishes the normal conversion of energy and the patient reacts with a definiteness unknown under other methods. It is the nature of every human being to be extremely sensitive to the constitutional simillimum.

BELLADONA is one of our best remedies for stiff neck caused by cutting the hair,getting the the head wet or sitting with the head and neck exposed to a draft, BELLADONA is the remedy. Bell is the best remedy for stiff neck of rheumatic origin or from cold. The stiffness is apt to be on the left side.
NUX VOM is indicated in torticolis, arising from cold or due to spinal disease.
CAUSTICUM has stiffness of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle of the right side,with drawing. It may be due to paralytic weakness,as in affections involving the spinal accessory nerve. Compare Agaricus, Lachnanthes.

I remember a case of APOPLEXY once that puzzled many physicians for some days, and I was puzzled too. The patient was in a profound stupor. OPIUM was administered by the Physician in charge before I arrived, and it stopped the stertorous breathing, but the patient remained unconscious. Finally it was observed that one side was moving, whilst the other side had not moved for many days, and that on the paralyzed side there was fever, while on the well side there was no fever. That was observed after careful examination for many days. I asked the doctor if he did not consider that the natural state of a paralyzed side would be coldness; he thought so too.
The whole paralyzed side of the patient had a feverish feeling to the hand, the other side was normal. That seemed to be the only STRANGE thing in the case; no speech, no effort to.do anything, no action of the bowels; a dose nothing case. After careful study ALUMINA was suited to the case, and in twelve hours after taking a dose of ALUMINA high potency that fever subsided on paralyzed side and patient returned to consciousness.

It is also seen in persons who have gone through a railroad accident, or through some shock, who are sore and bruised from injury. They rouse up in the night with a fear of sudden death, with an expression of terror; the horrors they really went through are repeated ARNICA MONT is the remedy. This is similar to OPIUM, only the OPIUM fear remains, even in the day time, ARNICA dreams of it.
Fear and its results. The OPIUM patient, when not too stupid, rouses up as if startled, rouses up with the appearance of awful fear or anxiety. If a dog jump at him suddenly, he will be thrown into convulsions, have diarrhoea, fits of some sort, and it Will be days and weeks before that fear is gone. Complaints from fear when the fear remains, or the cause of it comes before the eyes. A pregnant woman is frightened and an abortion is impending and the object of the fright, continually, looms up before her eyes. Epilepsy dating back to a fright, and that object comes up before the eyes before the attacks comes on, and the fear of the fright remains. Hysterical attack; physical shock with diarrhoea and sometimes constipation; retention of urine or return of the menstrual flow as results, or it may stop the menses for months. In these conditions there is great fear and the object of the fear remains before the eyes.
Fear will often cause abortion, but when ACONITE is given early enough it will check the abortion that comes from fear.

RAPHANUS is also to be thought of in cases with accumulation and retention of flatus. DR. J.B.BELL,one of our most eminent surgeons, performed an OPERATION on the abdomen.

You may go to the bedside of a patient who is suffering from what she calls " hives;" you will find she is covered from head to foot with an eruption that forms great nodules; she is fairly burning up from head to foot. She cannot endure any covering; the heat of his body is intense, yet she has no rise of temperature. Rough nodular manifestations all over the skin; a condition that will go away in a few hours, but in a few days, weeks or months come back again. A single dose of a very high potency of KALI IOD. will turn things into order in persons subject to these hives and they will not come again.
DR J T KENT
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

The repetition of the dose is determined by the nature and force of the response reveals the actual status of the patient in proportion to the accuracy of the prescription. The speed of the reaction is naturally governed by the course of the individual affection plus the vital reactive power of the individual. Hence it follows that a quick relief in chronic disease bodes no good, if the remedy has been properly chosen.
No second dose should be given as long as the relief progresses, even though slightly. The amelioration is apt to show itself in the mental state first; the mind becomes so more tranquil and suffering is more easily borne, although its intensity may as yet not be lessens.
In a real cure the symptoms recede from above downward, from within outward and in the reverse order of their coming ; all other ways are irregular and open to the suspicion of being mere palliations calculated to destroy the natural symmetry of the manifestations, hence to complicate and render the disease itractible.

It has been my fortune to see many cases of poisoning from the sting of the honey-bee. When the oversensitive patient is poisoned by the sting he is dreadfully sick. The majority of people in the course of their life have been stung by the honey-bee and a mere little swelling occurs in the region of the sting, a swelling as big as a robin's egg or a hen's egg at most without constitutional states;that is, when the individual is not sensitive to APIS. He may have been stung in a half dozen places, and each one gives him a little lump. But you meet one who is sensitive to the sting of the honey bee, and if he gets one little sting on in any place in his body, he comes down with nausia and anxiety that makes him feel that he is dying, and in about ten minutes he is covered with urticaria from head to foot ; he stings and burns and wants to be bathed in cold water;he fears that he will die if something is not done to mitigate his suffering, rolls and tosses as if he would tear himself to pieces. I have seen all these symptoms come on after APIS. The antidote for that is CARBOLIC ACD. I have seen CARBOLIC ACID administered in that state, and the patient described the sensation of the CARBOLIC ACID going down his throat as a cooling comfort. He says "Why, doctor, I can feel that dose go to the ends of my fingers." When you administer an antidote under such circumstances listen to what your patient says. When you get the true natural antidote, and, at times when you get the true curative medicine in a case, no matter how high the potency is, the patient will say :"I feel that to the roots of my hair and to the ends of my toes." Such is the feeling it gives when the true antidotal medicine goes to the innermost portions of his economy, and that is the way we want to get our medicines always, to be guided by the symptoms of our patient that they will tell us whatedicines to administer ., and when the medicine is administered its highest reaction is of that sort.

We should keep in mind the fact that the premature repitation or changing of remedies before reaction is finished does endless harm to the patient and almost hopelessly confuses the prescriber. The prescriber must know when to give remedy and when to hold his hand while nature expedites the forces to which he has given a new direction. He must know the power of sac lac and remember that an inward movement of the symptoms bodes no good.

Do not forget the symptoms of ARNICA MONT in appendicitis. You do not need to run for the surgeon for every case of appendicitis if you know BRYONIA, RHUS T, BELLADONA, ARNICA and similar remedies. The homoeopathic remedy will cure these cases,and if you know it, you need never run after the surgeon in appendicitis except in recurrent attacks. If you do not knows your remedies, you will succumb to the prevailing motion that it is necessary to open the abdomen and remove the appendix. It is only deplorable ignorance that causes appendicitis to be surrendered to the knife.

I have seen PULSATILLA cure a great many girls of sixteen to eighteen years old. The mother comes to me saying her daughter has suffered since her first menses; she went in swimming, or got her feet wet, and has suffered since. The doctor says the parts are undeveloped and she must be operated on. PULSATILLA has established a normal flow in a few months. Now I will give you a contrast in another remedy. Scrawny girls who are sensitive to cold, have also taken a bath at the time the first menses should appear, or have got the feet wet, and the flow is partially suppressed, or has come on with an inflammation; a state of in development is established, a stenosis; horrible menstrual colic; bearing down pains, as if everything would escape into the world, doubling the patient up; ameliorated by heat and aggravated by cold CALC PHOS is the remedy."

ANY REPERTORY ANALYSIS IS SURE ONLY WHEN IT MEETS PICTURE WE FIND IN MATERIAL MEDICA.
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

 could not practice medicine without IPEACAC , because of its importance in hemorrhages. When I say haemorrhages , I do not mean those from cut arteries, I do not mean hemorrhages where surgery must come in; I mean such as uterine hemorrhages, hemorrhage from the kidneys, from the bowels, stomach, from lungs. You must know your remedies in hemorrhages; if you do not you will be forced to use mechanical means; but the HOMOEOPATHIST who is well instructed is able to do without them. In the severest form of uterine hemorrhage the Homoeopathic physician is able to do without mechanical means, except when mechanical means are causing the hemorrhage. This does not relate to hourglass contractions, it does not relate to conditions when the after birth is retained, or when the uterous has a foreign substance in it, because under such circumstances manipulation is necessary. A distinction must be made. But when we have simply the pure dynamic element to consider, simply and purely a relaxed surface that is bleeding, the remedy is the only thing that will do the work properly.
When the uterus is continuously oozing, but every little while the flow increase to a gush and with every little gush of bright red blood the woman thinks she is going to faint, or there is gasping, and the quantity of the flow is not sufficient to account for such prostration, nausia ,syncope, pallor, IPEACAC is the remedy.
When with the gushing of bright red blood there is an overwhelming fear of death, ACONITE is her remedy.
If your patient while going through the confinement has had a hot head, an uncontrollable thirst for ice cold water and after the confinement, everything has gone on in an orderly way,and the placenta has been delivered and although you have no reason to expect such hemorrhage it comes on, PHOSPHORUS will nearly always be the remedy.
In those withered women, lean and slender, who are always suffering from the heat, who want the covers off and want to be cool, who have had a tendency to ooze blood from the uterus, and now have a hemorrhage that is alarming, either with clots, or only an oozing of dark, liquid blood, you can hardly do without SECALE. A single dose of any one of these medicines on the tongue will check a hemorrhage more quickly than large doses of strong medicine. The hemorrhage will be checked so speedily that in your earlier experiences you will be surprised. You will wonder if it is not possible that it stopped itself.

I know of no better guage of this vitality than the interest shown in repertory work, for the repertory is our chief instrument of precision. True some men do some good work without the repertory, but they also do poor work, more than they would do with it. A self-made artisan may be a very useful man although ignorant of the theory and most advanced methods obtaining in his line of work, but he can never measure up to the man whom education and thoroughness of method has made an expert. No such thing as infallibility in prescribing will ever be attained, but he who uses his repertory faithfully and intelligently ----and no one can do that without equal faithfulness and intelligence in his study of his Materia Medica----will in inevitably reap his reward, in results and in that peace of mind that comes only with an approving conscience. It is encouraging, therefore, to realize that there are some who desire to follow the better way.

Most cases of whooping cough, in the care of a homoeopathic physician, will get well in a week or ten days under a carefully selected remedy. When allowed to run,they continue a long time, gradually increasing for six weeks,and then declining according to the weather. If it is in the fall,the cough will sometimes keep up all winter; so whooping cough furnishes an opportunity for the homoeopathic physician to demonstrate that there is something in homoeopathy.

"When the patient, after having taken the medicine once, or oftener, begins to feel better, however little, he should discontinue it, lest the healthful progress of the cure be interfered with by taking too much;but as soon as the improvement ceases the same medicine should be taken again; or in cases the symptoms have altered, another more appropriate one."

The giving of ARNICA MONT after confinement is as old as Homoeopathy, but just to state that I do not always consider this to be good practice for the reason that in a majority of cases no remedy whatever is either needed or indicated and when one is called for it is not always ARNICA by any means. If we have reason to think that the deeper tissues have suffered most, a single drop of tincture BELLIS PERENIS will do much more than ARNICA and give you a pleasant surprise in the results that follows.
DR C M BOGER.
After childbirth you should use BELLIS PERENIS after childbirth and save your ARNICA.This is better remedy it has more affinity for uterus.
You can give 30C routinely after childbirth and you will see that the pain and bleeding will stop, it will help the sore bruised tenderness in the entire uterus area the uterus will go back to its normal shape quicker the person's energy will come up .

An interesting case was one of severe asthma of eight years duration, attack every fourteen days, confining her to bed,with absolutely and entirely Pulsatilla symptoms:- irritable, changeable, laughs and cries easily, fear of the dark, fear of death, suspicious, loathes fat, and dreams of cats.
Pulsatilla has all these symptoms in the highest type, and has caused dreams of cats! Pulsatilla in high potency was given in September,1929,and in January 1930,for a threat. She has remained well ever since.
If one could always get such clear-cut indications, prescribing would be indeed easy. This woman, after eight years of asthma, had actually only two attacks soon after her first dose of Pulsatilla.

BREECH PRESENTATION?
I had one peculiar case, but I am afraid to report everything. It was one of the cases of a midwife, experienced, well educated and of thirty years practice. I had seen a number of her cases and considered her highly accomplished; she occasionally sent for me to share the responsibility, and this one was a tedious case. She had diagnosed a breech presentation, and sent for me with a note saying she expected a two days job and wanted me to come and assure the family that if it should be three days it would have a favorable termination. I went to the house, made an examination, found a breech presentation and confirm her diagnosis. The dilation of the os was nearly as large as a half dollar. I gave a dose of PULSATILLA and assured the family as she requested me with all conscientiousness and thought no more about the case.
The next morning she called at my office. The patient I learned had a good many pains, irregular and spasmodic. She was a PULSATILLA patient, and I paid more attention to the case by taking symptoms and seeing what remedy would help her through. The midwife then said:" Why did you not tell me I made a mistake in that diagnosis? I am an old fool to practice midwifery for thirty years and not know a head presentation. You knew it was a head presentation. That child was born head first." It was born in a few hours after I left the house.

A married woman, 28 years old came to me from the country, with what a gynecologist had called a prolapsus. She was a tall, slim woman, otherwise in good health. She was wearing a Hodge pessary. She could not walk or stand long without her ring. She came. I removed the ring and gave her Sac,lac. At the end of a week I had noted the following symptoms.
The urine passed slowly, and she must wait a long time for it to start----SEPIA, LYCOP, ARN, HEPAR,ZINC, CANN-IND

She was greatly constipated, and always felt a lump in the rectum, even after stool.----SEPIA
She had a hungry, empty feeling in the stomach---SEP, MURX,IGN,HYDR and many others
She always had a bearing down in the pelvis, as if the uterus would issue from vagina----SEP, MURX LIL-T,NUX V, NATR M, PULS, etc
She must press on the vulva with a napkin for relief---SEP, MURX LIL-T
She often crosses her limbs to prevent the uterus from escaping---SEP

Patient feels much aching distress in the nose. NUX V patient ordinarily wants warmth and warm air and a warm room, but with coryza he is very opposite ; he wants motion in open air, he looks for cool air for it > the distressing sensation. In the warm room there is a ticking sensation in the nose, and the nose will drip, night and day. NUX V coryza is < in the house, in the night, and< in the warm bed, so that the discharge will run all over the pillow.

Experience leads to the conclusion that the patient's actions and what he says of himself, are of the highest important and may not be lightly set aside. Just so do drugs, in their general action, exhibit this or that predominant phase, and when one finds its counterpart in the other, the SIMILLIMUM has been descovered, provided the remedy contains the characteristics of the case, in hand, also. For example we do not think of PH-AC for excitable, or COFFEE for lethergic patients, unless the individualistic symptoms call for these remedies in the most positive way, an unlikely contingency. The quality of the general reaction greatly influences symptoms values, be they pathogenetic or clinical.

The scientific method is the mechanical method; taking all the symptoms and writing out all the associated remedies with gradings, making a summary with grades marked, at the end.
There is an artistic method that omits the mechanical, and is better, but all are not prepared to use it. The artistic method demands that judgment be passed on all the symptoms, after the case is most carefully taken. The symptoms must be judged as to their value as characteristics, in relation to the patient;they must be passed in review by the rational mind to determine those which are strange,rare and peculiar.
Symptoms most peculiar to the patient must be taken first, then those less and less peculiar until the symptoms that are common and not peculiar are reached, in order, from first to last.
As HOMOEOPATHY includes both science and art, REPERTORY must consist of science and art.

It is well to remember one point in looking for symptoms in the repertory, and that is, when you can not find the symptoms as given in the language of the patient, do not despair and throw down the book for some symptoms until you find what you are looking for, and when you have found this make a cross reference in your repertory so it will easiar the next time.
Again many fail to use the repertory because they think of symptoms in pathological terms. Symptoms are recorded in the Materia Medica in the language of provers who were mostly laymen, and as the repertory is simply an index to the materia medica the rubrics must be in their simple language.

Dysentery:-
Merc Sol has a well-defined dysentric condition. Slimy,bloody stools with much straining, he feels as if he could never finish,even when no more is passing, a never-get-done feeling. 
This is very opposite of Nux and Rhus t in dysentery. These are > if a little stool is passed, but Merc and Sulphur,will sit and strain,and all the salts of Merc. have the same state. Merc cor. has a more violent attack,with violent urging to stool and to urinate, and intense suffering,with burning in the parts and the passage of pure blood.

The final analysis of every case, therefore, resolves itself into the assembling of the individualistic symptoms into one group and collecting the disease manifestations into another, then finding the remedy which runs through both, while placing the greater emphasis on the former. This method applies to repertory making just as fully as it does to case taking and prescribing. Therefore the over large rubrics of our repertories are likely to be more useful for occasional confirmatory reference, then for the running down of the final remedy.

CICUTA VIROSA
GUERNSEY says," Think of this remedy for convulsions which are excessively violent- whether epileptic, cataleptic, clonic or tonic ; eclampsia."
The convulsions extend from center to circumference. The convulsion spread from above downwards and thus it is opposite of CUPRUM. The convulsions of CPRUM spread from the extremities to the centre; the little convulsions, cramps are first felt in fingers then hands, later in chest and whole body. In CICUTA the little convulsions of head, eyes and throat spread down the back with violent contortions.
Between the convulsions the patient is mild, gentle, placid,yielding, reverse of NUX V and STRYCH. NUX V has convulsions all over the body, worse for touch and draught,blueness: between the convulsions the patient is very irritable.
After swallowing a fish bone or stick which lodges in the throat a spasm comes on. After CICUTA the spasm will cease and it can be taken out. It is useful in cases of injury, accompanied with violent choking, so that he can not allow an examination to be made.

HOMOEOPATHIC PROGNOSIS
A well correct medicine applied to a sick individual operates within sphere corresponding to its action will overthrow the disease; on the other hand if the reaction remains absent or new symptoms appear during the operation of the drug, the prognosis is grave.

Measles, when they come out with the purplish color, very often require SULPHUR. SULPHUR is a great remedy in measles. The routinist can do pretty well in the disease with PULSATILLA and SULPHUR, occasionally requiring ACONITE and EUPHRASIA. Especially will SULPHUR modify the case when the skin is dusky and the measles do not come out.

With menses too late or suppressed or scanty, the patient weeping, with aversion to fats, nausia, vomiting, weight after eating, the young man will say PULSATILLA at once; but wait a moment. The patient is very chilly, likes the house, never needs the open window, is worse from motion, wants keep very quiet; now you change your mind and give her CYCLAMEN. Or if she is better in motion and in open air, and craves it, and warm blooded, then PULSATILLA.

A woman has passed through an abortion and placenta has come away, but every few days a little gush of fresh, bright red blood and clots, or going days and weeks with a little oozing of bright red blood; every time she gets on her feet there is a new start of the flow; no tendency to permanent recovery. Two remedies that fit this state are SULPHUR and PSORINUM. A marked state of relaxation,subinvolution. The uterus does not go back to its normal size and there is this tendency to bleed; a state of inertia.
DR.J.T.KENT.
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

In persons who have overworked, who have been working day and night to establish a business, or to keep it up, and when there has been constant use of brain FLUORIC ACID is suitable. In mental depression and melancholy, with great sadness, in young men who have destroyed the nervous system by viscous practices, by secret vice(masterbation). It is particularly suitable for that disorder of the human economy where men have continuously change their mistresses. There is a state in which a man is never satisfied with one woman, but continually changes and goes from bad to worse until he is a debauchee. If a young man can not keep away from women, he is not so bad off if he will only keep to one, but he goes from one to many, until he stands upon the street corners and, in his lust, craves the innocent women that go along the street. FLUORIC ACID is suitable in that state, like PICRIC ACID and SEPIA, and these medicines are particularly suited to that condition of enfeeblement of the mind and that disorder of the human economy that makes man so low, that we have the state described as "low mindedness". It takes that form in one who is a short of debauchee, running after all sorts of things to tickle his fancy, but it takes another form in a man who stays at home with his good wife. He takes an aversion to his children and to his dearest friends and his wife, that is, he has lost that true and noble and orderly affection and friendship and companionship which ought to exist, and he fights against it. An orderly man considers his wife his best friend and he would rather stay with her than go anywhere else. To him there is no place like home. Now , when man arrives at the state when he wants to go somewhere else, that he wants to go away from home, that he is disturbed at home that every thing annoys him at home, that he no longer loves his children as he once did, he needs FLUORIC ACID.

We should keep in mind the fact that the premature repitation or changing of remedies before reaction is finished does endless harm to the patient and almost hopelessly confuses the prescriber. The prescriber must know when to give remedy and when to hold his hand while nature expedites the forces to which he has given a new direction. He must know the power of sac lac and remember that an inward movement of the symptoms bodes no good.

At times you will go into confinement room when the woman has pains in the back below the waist line. The pains in the uterus are very weak, they are not sufficiently expulsive to make progress in the labor, the kind of pain that makes the woman utter the cry, " My back, my back!" The pain extends down the buttocks and legs. Pain in the back as if the back would break. Under good prescribing these pains are changed into contractions, which prove sufficient to expel the contents of the uterus. When you hear such things you will look back over the history of the case. You will look back for weeks as the woman has been drawing near the end of gastation and see that the vague things, the chilliness and other features in her constitutional state for which you have been trying to find a remedy now culminate at the time of her confinement into a class of pains. Had you seen that six weeks before and given her KALI CARB you would have prevented the severe labor. It is a severe labor, a prolonged labor; the uterus appears to be weak, and the pains are feeble; they are all in the back, and do not go to centre of operation as they should think KALI CARB. 
Now, this same kind of a pain may deceive you in taking another form. The pain begin in the back, and appear to go to the uterus and then run up the back, which would turn you aside entirely from the KALI CARB pain, into a pain that would indicate GELSEMIUM. Sometimes these pains are so severe that they actually seem to prevent rather than encourage the contractions of the uterus cease, and the woman screams out and wants her hips rubbed, and screams out with pain in each side of the abdomen rather than in the centre, pains in the region where the broad ligaments ought to be, ACTEA RACMOSA will make the pain regular.
PUISATILLA is the medicine for absence of marked contraction, I cases inclined to do nothing; in a case that is inactive when the is sufficiently dialated and the parts relaxed, and the prediction is an easy and simple labor, but the patient does not do anything. It is a state of mildness or inactivity.PULSATILLA will very often cause in five minutes a very strong contraction of the uterus, sometimes almost in a painless way. For weak pains PULSATILLA stands high. Most often called for when the patient is not irritable and the pains are very feeble, lasting for several days, and doing nothing; irregular, flitting changeable pains, now up the back now down the limbs, a prolonged first stage or prolonged preparatory symptoms. CHAMOMILLA is more suitable if the woman is extremely irritable.
In ACONIT pregnant woman says doctor, I am going to die in that confinement. If there is any one thing that is a really strong symptoms to prescribe on it is that. A dose of ACONITE, and then change the subject. Fear of death is present.
DR JT KENT( There are so many remedies)
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

In lepra vulgaris the defuse form of PSORIASIS when it occurs in large patches about the size of the palm over the abdomen and other parts of the body, with heat and redness, and itching worse at night, in the warmth of the bed. PULSATILLA has worked wonders. It goes to the bottom and cures it in an orderly way. This is a feature that is not brought out in any of the books. From the observation of this fact I have been able to cure the mange in dogs at once with PULS. when the disease took this patchy form. We see the depth of action of this drug also in its ability to antidote the effects of SULPHUR. When Sulphur has been used externally and internally to suppress itch, PULSATILLA will antidote it and bring back the itch.
In all skin diseases, let it be your aim to fit the remedy to the constitution of the patient and not to the character of the eruption alone. Always leave the consideration of the skin to the last. When the reverse is done and the remedy suits only the eruption, while the skin symptoms are benefitted, the patient is invariabley made worse.

It is not such an unusual thing in the female to have aversion to sexual intercourse, but man is not often subject to the complaints that cause aversion to coition. Yet we have in man as well as in the woman actual aversion or a state of no enjoyment. He can perform the act and he has no difficulty in obtaining an erection, so it is not impotence; but there is no enjoyment. Impotence comes later. "Absence of erections; parts flabby, torpid." " Aversion to coition; impotence; want of emission during coitus."---PSORINUM is the remedy

Aversion to marriage is a strong symptoms. A man takes it into his head that it is an evil thing to have sexual intercourse with his wife and abstains from it. Think of PULSATILLA
In KENT'S Repertory rubric---
Marriage, the idea of seemed unendurable-- LACH, PIC- AC, PULS

Now you will take notice in practice and remember it, that coition is a natural thing with man, when it is carried on in order, and when that which is natural is followed by prostration, and this has been so for a long time, there is a break in the constitution, there is something radically wrong. All the symptoms are likely to be worse after coition in KALI CARB. He has weak vision, weakness of the senses, tremulousness, and is generally nervous; he is sleepless, and weak, and he shivers and trembles for a day or two after coition. Similar symptoms are observed in the woman. In spite of the fact that the patient is weak, the sexual desire is excessive. It is not orderly. There is a sexual erethism, which is not under the command of the will, and in the male he is subject to copious and frequent pollutions, nightly dreams, sexual prostration.
Young man who have abused themselves, and who have indulged excessively in sexual pleasure, go into marriage with weakened genitals, incapacitated; and then there comes a disgust, and it is not strange and there are so many divorces in the world. When patient is young, some of this trouble can be overcome by living an orderly life and correct HOMOEOPATHY.

It is well to remember one point in looking for symptoms in the repertory, and that is, when you can not find the symptoms as given in the language of the patient, do not despair and throw down the book for some symptoms until you find what you are looking for, and when you have found this make a cross reference in your repertory so it will easiar the next time.
Again many fail to use the repertory because they think of symptoms in pathological terms. Symptoms are recorded in the Materia Medica in the language of provers who were mostly laymen, and as the repertory is simply an index to the materia medica the rubrics must be in their simple language.
DR G I BIDWELL
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

There are some cases of PNEUMONIA that need KALI CARB, in the stage of HEPATIZATION (like SULPHUR). Again, when pneumonia has passed away think of KALI CARB. If every time patient takes a little cold it settles in the chest with these symptoms( Dry hacking ,incessant, gagging cough with whooping, blowing blood from the nose, vomiting of everything in the stomach, and expectoration of blood-streaked mucus, is a whooping cough that will be commonly cured by KALI CARB, but especially if there is present that peculiar and striking feature of a bag like swelling below the eyebrows and above the lids, puffiness of the eyes.). There is sensitiveness of the body to weather changes, to cold air and to wet, a continuous dry, hacking cough, with gagging, the aggravation from three to five in the morning and the patient has flying neuralgic pains. These symptoms gradually increase and the patient dates them back to his PNEUMOIA. He says:"Doctor, I have never well since I had PNEUMONIA." The catarrhal state has settled in his chest and there is a chronic tendency to take cold. These cases are threatening to go into phthisis and will hardly be likely to recover without KALI CARB. In this tendency for catarrhal state to locate in the chest, KALI CARB. should be thought of as well as PHOSPHORUS,LYCOPODIUM, SULPHUR. 
After PNEUMONIA patient takes a cold and it settles in the chest--KALI CARB, LYCO, PHOSPHORUS, SULPHUR.

The child is born after some difficulty, and seems to be doing well, but in a few days it is reported to be not quite right. It may be that an arm or a leg is rather limp, is not used properly or the face seems somewhat asymmetrical, or there is some difficulty in sucking. There has been some intracranial hemorrhage. ARNICA MONT will help the absorption of the blood and induce the maximum recovery of the damaged nerve tissue.

CEPHALAETOMA-- Sanguineous Tumor of the head in children
Of the sanguineous tumors sometimes developed upon the percranium and bones of the head of newborn children, the writer has met with quite a number. And he has always been successful in curing them in a few days with a single dose of CALCARIA CARB, high. HURTMAN recommends ARNICA M, OR RHUSTOX 30.
If there result an ichorous discharge and caries of the bone, and prostration, the same auther prescribes CHINA, and afterward SILICEA. But in my opinion, CALC CARB, given at the first, will save any further trouble.

There is a remedy for inflammation of the tonsils where the ear is involved and is > by heat, that very few use, but it is great value; it is CHAMOMILLA, and it is especially indicated if the patient is irritable.

USE OF BOGER'S SYNOPTIC KEY
It is the aim of this book to simplify and introduce method into this work, so that the truly homeopathic curative remedy may be selected out with greater ease and certainty. For this purpose a combination of the analytic and synoptic methods has been thought best.
DR C.M.BOGER
In the SYNOPTIC KEY, BOGER takes the concept of generalizing as near to its practical limit as possible. BOGER developed this Repertory over many years and added new rubrics with caution, only when this personal work needed them. This made it more practical and guarded against including less pertinent rubrics. He made a serious attempt to unite ANALYSIS and SYNTHESIS in each rubric, expressed as one or two words. In this way the unavoidable clumsiness inherent in repertory use is streamlined to a great degree.
RICHARD PITCAIRN
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

It has the ability to delay the formation of malignant growths, especially in the breast; glandular tumors that become hard and scirrhous. Until this remedy was known there was but one remedy for the old cicatrices in the memmary gland. Women who were confined years before, had access of the breast which were poulticed and lanced had a cicatricx left, and now in the present confinement they have trouble; inflammation in the old cicatrices; ulceration which eats off the lacteal glands or turns the ducts aside and twists them; high inflammation; throbbing and pain; milk bloody. GRAPHITIS was the old routine remedy, but PHYTOLACCA is a better remedy and suits the general concomitants oftener. The symptoms usually found in an inflamed breast after confinement are; Aching in the back and bone pains; fever and shivering. PHYTOLACCA has these and falls into the very nature of the case. GRAPHITES has it only limited way. If there is high fever; congestion to the head; throbbing carotids; much redness, and the redness radiates from the nipple, BELLADONA is the remedy. When the entire gland is as heavy as a stone, and hard, and the patient is sensitive to motion and touch, BRYONIA. MERCURY when the general symptoms agree. HEPAR and SILICEA after suppuration is envitable, especially when the only comfort is obtained from heat. HEPAR when there is extreme pain and soreness, irritability and this relief from heat; it limits the extent of the suppuration and opens the part without pain.

The unfortunate children, born The unfortunate children, born after a difficult labour, fall roughly into two classes- the blue or asphyxiated and the pale.
The child with blue asphyxia has no mechanical obstruction, but he does not breathe. Surface stimulation does not produce the desired effect, or does this for a very short time only. Very soon pulse begins to fail. Everyone is becoming anxious. Unpleasant thoughts begin to suggest themselves; thoughts of the mother and all she has just come through, thoughts of the father waiting for news, begin to force their way through. A dose of LAUROCERASUS and the whole scene is changed, the child breathes and then cries.
The pale ,collapsed child is less dramatic and more pitiful. It lies limp, flaccid, cold. Its heart sounds are hardly to be heard. It is all but dead. Warmth, stimulants, friction, seem to produce no response. The child lies as one drowned. CARBO VEG will give child back, alive into its mother's arms.

Hemorrhoids;
Most troublesome constipation with haemorrhiods; violent pain in, < lying down,> gentle motion, > moving about in the open air, <warmth of bed. She becomes so nervous in a room while at rest that the pain seem intensified and she must move about. "Haimorrhiods; painful, protruding, blind, with itching and stitches in anus." -PULSATILLA 
The aggravation from lying down in extremely painful haemorrhiods is contrasted with AMON CARB. which has violently painful haemorrhiods > lying flat on the back.
In violently painful haemorrhiods, with intense burning, think of ARSENIC ALB and KALI CARB.
In those sticking, tearing pains study AESCULUS.
Looking over a number of years I have been forced to use in these cases a remedy not yet fully proven. In painful haemorrhiods,in a broken down constitution, where the whole disease seems to culminate in the haemorrhiods; bleeding, protruding ; a mere touch almost causes a convulsion; it causes her to scream out at the top of her voice; it is so painful that she feels that death would be a relief; she lies in bed holding the nates far apart with her hands; after every stool she has three or four hours of extreme suffering. In these cases look up the PAEONY.
The haemorrhiods it cures look like the flowers of the plant, they are so inflamed, so red and bleeding; oozing; teder to touch; patient is so worn out with the pain. It has many times relieved the pain and cured these eno rmous haemorrhidal tumors. I have cured them after they had been operated on, and all sorts of violence done them, without relief.
Do not go to this drug if you can find a remedy that covers all the patient. Many patients will not confess any other symptoms, and some of these will suffer so much fr the haemorrhiods alone that you will really need this remedy.

A woman well in the seventies had a dangerous abcess of the gall bladder followed in four months by apoplexy and left sided paralysis, then came recurring cerebral congestions with violent head pains which cause her to scream out, pull her hair and role the eyeballs from side to side. There was some paralysis of deglutition and a heavy dry coat on the tongue. Several doses of CUPRUM M.MM given at long intervals made her very comfortable, cleared the tongue, removed the throat paralysis and restored the appetite, but did not affect the vascular degeneration.

SEPIA comes in when the woman ought to menstruate when the child ceases to nurse; sometimes the child dies and menses ought to be established but do not appear, the mother runs down, pines away; SEPIA will establish the flow.
CALC C is the opposite; the menses come on while the child is nursing.
CARB-AN--- Whenever patient puts the child to the breast she has a sensation of emptiness in the stomach, sinking in the pit of the stomach, and she must take the child away.
Every time the child is put the breast, cramping of the uterus; cramp in the back. Either of these , or both, CHAMOMILLA cures. 
The two principal remedies you will have to rely on for theses conditions,cramping in the back and cramping in the abdomen every time the child is put to the breast, are CHAMOMILLA andPULSATILLA.
They are two decidedly different remedies in the mental sphere.

Absence or suppression of menses for many months, the patient being withered, declining, pale and sallow, becoming feeble. It seems that she has not the vitality to menstruate. It is also suitable in girls at puberty when the time for the first menstrual flow to appear has come, but it does not come. She goes 15,16,17,or 18 years without development, the breast do not enlarge, the overies do not perform their functions. When the symptoms agree LYCOPODIUM establishes a reaction, the breast begin to grow, the womanly bearing begins to come, and the child becomes a woman. It is a wonderful power for developing, and in that respect it is very much like CALC. PHOS.

The scientific method is the mechanical method; taking all the symptoms and writing out all the associated redies with gradings, making a summary with grades marked, at the end.
There is an artistic method that omits the mechanical, and is better, but all are not prepared to use it. The artistic method demands that judgment be passed on all the symptoms, after the case is most carefully taken. The symptoms must be judged as to their value as characteristics, in relation to the patient;they must be passed in review by the rational mind to determine those which are strange,rare and peculiar.
Symptoms most peculiar to the patient must be taken first, then those less and less peculiar until the symptoms that are common and not peculiar are reached, in order, from first to last.
As HOMOEOPATHY includes both science and art, REPERTORY must consist of science and art.
DR J T KENT
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

A REPERTORY is especially an index and may be advantageously used as such for discovering particular symptoms as well as for grouping remedies containing similar combinations in their Pathogeneses. The latter, as it insures an unique comprehensiveness of grasp is by far its most important use. Such groups are often large, and when so, are necessarily thinned out by eliminating all the remedies which lack the essential, general and specials regional O'Connor ions. "It should be borne in mind that the conditions, especially if regional, are apt to modify almost any symptoms that the remedy may posses.

The diagnosis of the Homoeopathic remedy in a given case is not an easy task especially in the practice of classical Homoeopathy. It is assumed that the case history has been well taken. Key note method and drug picture indications are well-known as a method of diagnosis of the remedy and practiced by many. Extensive and deep familiarity with the Materia Medica are of course, essential pre-requsites. There are, however, cases which can be solved only with the help of repertory, especially for the beginners. For many therefore, Homoeopathic Repertory is a very important part of our armanterium.
DR JUGAL KISHORE
(RAJENDRA KUMAR JHA)

You get another type of neuralgia--- the sciaticas. And there again you can get helpful leads. In cases of sciatica, in which I can get no indications at all but the ordinary classical symptoms of sciatica, that is to say, acute pain down the sciatic nerve, which is aggravate by any movement, is very sensitive to cold, more comfortable if kept quiet and warm, then it depends which leg is involved what drug I give. If it is a right sided sciatica I give MAG PHOS, but if it is a left sided I give COLOCYNTH. And you would be astonished how often one gets almost immediate relief from either MAG PHOS or CLOCYNTH.
Some sciatica patients are frigtfully uncomfortable the longer they keep still, they have got to start moving, and there are to drugs which seem to cover the majority of these cases. If the patient is warm blooded, and the sciatic pains tend to be more troublesome when warm, particularly warmth of bed, and rather better when moving about, in the majority of instances one gets relief from KALI IOD.
If, on the other hand, you have very much the same modalities with a chilly patient, particularly if he is sensitive to damp as well as cold, and again more comfortable when moving about, RHUS TOX will clear majority of such cases.
Then there are one or two odd indications which sometimes help you in sciatica where you can get no other distinguishing symptoms. For instance, if you get a sciatica which has associated with the acute sciatic pain, marked numbness, there are two drugs which cover most of your cases. One is GNAPHALIUM, which has this sensation of numbness associated with pain and tenderness over the sciatic nerve more marked than any other drug in the materia medica.
The second drug which has this numbness associated with pain and tenderness of the sciatic nerve is PLUMBUM, and the main indication which suggests this remedy is that. I have never seen a sciatica giving indications for PLUMBUM which was not associated with extreme constipation as well as the pain and numbness.
DR D M BORLAND 
(A case of sciatica cured by PULSATILLA with following indications; pain agg morning, stooping amel, side right. Taken by the aid of Boger's synoptic key)

KALI IOD cures sciatica when pain is sharp from the hip down, worse lying, sitting or standing and better walking.
RUTA GRAVEOLA the severest forms of sciatica; pains commence in the back and go down the hips and thighs; tearing pains; comfortable during the day, but aggravated as soon as he lies down at night.
GNAPHALIUM is a great sciatic remedy, and it also has this aggravation from lying down.
PULSATILLA; sciatica worse in the evening and better from slowly moving about.
COLOCYNTH; with many doctor it is a routine remedy for sciatica; and only when it fails to do they take the symptoms of the case in order to find the remedy that is indicated. There is no excuse for such practice. Where the pain is better from hard pressure and from heat, where it is worse during repose and drive the patient to despair, COLOCYNTH will generally cure. But it is not indicted in every cases
DR J T KENT

AMMONIUM MUR is very readily cured sciatica when the symptoms call for it. The pains are worse while the patient is sitting, somewhat relieved while he is walking and entirely relieved when he lies down.
